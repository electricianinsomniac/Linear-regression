# Problem Statement
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.
- You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
- The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
